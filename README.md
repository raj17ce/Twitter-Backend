   npm install
   ```

3. **Create `.env` file:**

   - Duplicate `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
   - Update the `DatabaseURI` variable with the appropriate MongoDB URI. Make sure to append `/dbname` at the end of the URI.
   - Update the `PORT` number to suit your requirements.
   - Set the `JWTSecretKey` to any secure string of your choice, but ensure it remains confidential and is not exposed.

Note: You can run the project either locally or with Docker Compose, depending on your preference. Below is a guide for both methods, choose whichever suits your needs.
  
### üíª Run Locally

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- `Node.js` (v12 or above)
- `MongoDB Community Server` or `Atlas` (Not needed if you run MongoDB on a Docker container) 
- `Docker` (for running MongoDB in a container, optional)

4. **Run a MongoDB instance:**

   You can run MongoDB in one of the following ways:

   1. **Run MongoDB Community Server locally:**
      Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.

   2. **Run MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas (Cloud):**
      Set up a MongoDB Atlas instance and copy the connection URI.

   3. **Run MongoDB in a Docker Container:**
      Use the following command to run MongoDB in a Docker container:

      ```bash
      docker run --name mongodb-server -p 27017:27017 -d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
      ```

5. **Start the server:**

   You can run the server in development mode or production mode:

   - For development:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - For production:

     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```

### üßä Run using Docker-Compose

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- `Docker` (run `docker --version` to check)
- `Docker-Compose` (run `docker-compose --version` to check)

4. **Start the Server**
   
   Run the following command to run this multi container backend server using docker-compose.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## üå± Health Check
   To ensure that the application and the MongoDB database are running smoothly, you can perform a health check by sending a GET request to the following endpoint:

   ```bash
   GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
   ````

   Below is a sample success response. If you get this response, it means that the Server and Database is UP and Running.
   ```json
   {
      "success": true,
      "message": "Server and Database is Up and Running.",
      "data": {
         "status": "UP",
         "services": {
               "database": "connected"
         }
      },
      "err": {}
   }
   ```
